  You can use tags, snippets and assets in your messages just as you would in a page. 
  There are also a few simple mailmerge tags that you can use to place information about the recipient (or yourself) in each message as it is sent out. 
  Most are self-explanatory:
%ul.help
  %li
    %code &lt;r:sender:name /&gt;
    is the name configured in 
    %em
      reader.mail_from_name:
    currently 
    %strong
      = "'#{Radiant::Config['reader.mail_from_name']}'."
  %li
    %code &lt;r:sender:email /&gt;
    is the address configured in 
    %em
      reader.mail_from_address:
    currently 
    %strong
    = "'#{Radiant::Config['reader.mail_from_address']}'."
  %li
    %code &lt;r:recipient:name /&gt; 
  %li
    %code &lt;r:recipient:email /&gt;
  %li
    %code &lt;r:recipient:password /&gt; 
    only works in welcome messages: after first login we forget the unencrypted password
  %li
    %code &lt;r:recipient:url /&gt;
    is the address of the page about this person
  %li
    %code &lt;r:recipient:edit_url /&gt; 
    is the address of the preferences form
  %li
    %code &lt;r:recipient:activation_url /&gt;
    is the address that will activate a newly-created account
  - if Radiant.config['reader.show_descriptions?']
    %li
      %code &lt;r:recipient:description /&gt;
